Ruby version: 2.0.0

Benchsparks is a multiplication fluency app that allows students to make the most of their limited computer time
by having them answer as many multiplication questions as possible.  There is no teaching element to the app as that is the
job of the teacher, instead this app is geared towards teachers who want to build a fluency for their students with an app
that takes the rote task of multiplication memorization and gamifies it in an exiting fast paced way.  There are also a set of
supplemental and rich teacher tabs for teachers to be able to track the abundance of data that the studnets produce in practicing
to best inform their teaching.
